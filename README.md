# Spark Exercises
Spark examples and exercises developed as way of training Spark skills.
 
## Sample applications

The project is a collection of self-contained spark micro-applications tackling specific problems with different
approaches but having in common the use of [Apache Spark][1].

### Matrix (map-reduce) multiplication

This example solves distributed matrix multiplication using a pure map-reduce algorithm. Other approaches such as
 traditional matrices multiplications of sub-matrices at different workers should be more efficent.
